Hello everybody and welcome to yet another "AI learns how to play game XXXX videooo"

Well this one is special, because we are playing SpaceCadet!
If you know SpaceCadet you probably have back pains, you are 30% bolder and some white hair has shown up.
Well, lucky you, because you are going to get a blast from the paaaast

Let's start with a quick recap of what we are going to do.

1. We are going to develop the game from scratch!! And by from scratch, I mean from someone else code!

2. We are going to modify the game source code to be able to control the game from our own python program. Also we are going to enable "game outputs" to our python program which will serve as our AI's inputs

3. We are going to create one Genetic Neural Network that will evolve based on a simple genetic algorithm to slooooowwwwwwly get better and better! And by one Neural network I mean maaaaany [picture of multiple AIs playing pinball]. And by slowly I mean mimicing natural selection and evolution theory!! Yes we are becoming GODS for this [funny evil laugh picture]

So lets get started!
